A fortune(6) reimplementation in C++.

This is an implementation of the classic BSD fortune, written mostly to
play with C++ (ported from a Rust version I wrote to play with Rust).

For those not acquainted with fortune(6), it's a small utility that picks
messages at random from a given set of cookie jar files, such as:

$ src/fortune
It is not a good omen when goldfish commit suicide.


Most options from the original fortune are available:

Usage: src/fortune [options] [[n%] file/dir]...
Options:
    -a          choose from all lists of maxims
    -c          show the cookie file from which the fortune came
    -e          consider all fortune files to be of equal size
    -f          print out the list of files to be searched
    -h          display usage information and exit
    -i          ignore case for -m patterns
    -l          long dictums only
    -m pattern  print all fortunes matching the regex
    -n len      set the longest length considered short
    -o          choose only from potentially offensive aphorisms
    -s          short apothegms only
    -w          wait before termination
